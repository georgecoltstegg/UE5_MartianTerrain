# Mars Unreal Engine 5 Environment

## Project
This project was originally just to test out the new features of Unreal Engine 5 while I was working on a previous Unreal Engine 4.26 project at NASA. I imported high fidelity cliffs, materials, astronaut model, etc. In this scene you can walk around with a rigged and animated astronaut character in a small scale realistic looking Mars terrain.

## Background
I have previously spent about a year working at the NASA Johnson Space Center working on the Mars2030 virtual reality project as part of the Advanced Operations and Concepts Laboratory. Since then, I have been at Texas A&M University studying Aerospace Engineering but also have an extreme interest in video games and video game design.
